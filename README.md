Coding part is done in 2 different .py files. As Minimum spanning tree and Shortest path topics are to be coded on both directed and undirected graphs, they are combined in a single code. Finding Strongly Connected components of a graph requires to check only on directed graphs, hence it is implemented in different code with different input text files that include directed graphs.
